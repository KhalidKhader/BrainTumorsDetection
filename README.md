Brain Tumors Detection

ABSTRACT One of the most severe types of cancer is brain tumors that can be detected using magnetic resonance brain images (MRI). We will develop a machine-learning model that can detect brain tumors using MRI scans as data input for this model. Brain tumors are normal growths of brain tissue that can be malignant or normal. Early detection and classification of brain tumors are critical to treating the disease or mitigating its outcomes. This model should be able to differentiate between different types of brain tumors. This model will be implemented using a supervised learning approach such as a convolutional neural network (CNN) or other Machine Learning and Deep Learning techniques.
 ## I. INTRODUCTION
Recently, the percentage of people with cancer has increased. Among the most severe types of cancer that are often fatal are brain tumors. If they are malignant, the survival rate is often weak if detected late, while if detected early, this can help the patient to recover or at least partially recover. Cancer is detected by special X-rays called Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), a common medical imaging technique used to diagnose and monitor brain tumors. In this project, we just want to develop a machine- learning model that can accurately detect and classify brain tumors in MRI scans. This research will use many artificial intelligence techniques, especially machine learning, and we may use deep learning to get results with a higher accuracy rate, as the data entered as input will be MRI scans of patients with brain tumors and MRI scans of people with no brain tumors. The inputs will be pre- processed to remove noise, and artifacts, then segmented to identify the tumor regions and then classify the tumor type. We will use a supervised learning approach to train our model. We will build the model using a Deep learning approach like a convolutional neural network (CNN). This model must be able to differentiate between different types of brain tumors and provide clinicians with a valuable tool for the early diagnosis and treatment of brain tumors.
II. MOTIVATION AND PROBLEM STATEMENT
Cancer is one of the most famous diseases that cause death in the world. The number of cancer deaths in the world increases annually at least by 21%. This dangerous indicator indicates the danger of this disease and the need for early detection to get treatment. One of the most dangerous types is the brain tumor which can be detected in several ways, the most important of which is the Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) method that can identify brain tumors by scanning the brain and identifying the affected areas, but in order to accurately determine the affected area,
we must use several accurate methods and mechanisms using artificial intelligence in order to accurately detect the disease in the initial stages. In this research, we need to develop a machine-learning model that can detect brain tumors in MRI scans. This model aims to determine if the person is infected or not. If infected, we must determine the location and size of the tumor to know its severity. Based on that, the stage and severity of the disease are determined, and then a treatment can be found. This model will be trained on a data set containing MRI scans with several infected and uninfected scans and injuries of different sizes and locations. The effectiveness and accuracy of the model will be determined by comparing it with the results of a valid and accurate data set. One of the most severe types of cancer is brain tumors that can be detected using magnetic resonance brain images (MRI). We will develop a machine- learning model that can detect brain tumors using MRI scans as data input for this model. Brain tumors are normal growths of brain tissue that can be malignant or normal. Early detection and classification of brain tumors are critical to treating the disease or mitigating its outcomes. This model should be able to differentiate between different types of brain tumors.

##  II.A WHY MRI?
Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is a widely used imaging for the diagnosis of brain tumors due to its superior soft tissue contrast and tissue-penetrating ability to visualize the brain at multiple levels and layers. However, the interpretation of MRI scans can be difficult, and time-consuming in addition it requires the expertise of trained radiologists and skilled doctors, on
##  III. LITRITURE REVIEW
Firstly, we need to prepare the image to be ready for the detection phase so we will use some techniques to pre- process the MRI Images some researchers like Rajendra Acharya use accurate Machine Learning models for brain tumor detection and classification to enhance the quality of MRI images then we need to detect the features to be extracted [1]. Several feature extraction methods include texture analysis, shape analysis, and wavelet analysis [2]. Deep learning techniques such as convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have also been used for feature extraction [3]. range of techniques has been proposed for this purpose, including intensity normalization, filtering, segmentation, and texture analysis. Another Experiment that uses Deep learning techniques such as Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN), and Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN) are also used for brain tumor detection which uses Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) as a dataset with some Preprocessing techniques such as 2D brain extraction algorithm (BEA), FMRIB software library, and BSE for non-brain tissue removal. The bias field is corrected using linear, nonlinear, fixed, multi-scale, and pixel-based techniques. AFINITI is used for brain tumor segmentation [4]. One of the most common techniques to use Deep-Learning to classify and detect brain tumors as the study developed using MRI Scans with the CNN architecture with an accuracy of 93.9% using a data set containing 306 MRI brain scans [5]. Another study using Deep-Learning Which develops a novel brain tumor segmentation method by integrating fully convolutional neural networks (FCNNs) and Conditional Random Fields (CRFs) in a unified framework to obtain segmentation results with appearance and spatial consistency using 2D image patches and slices that can be
the other side we must be careful about the effects and dangers of dealing with this type of radiation. Therefore, accurate and automated tools are needed to aid in the diagnosis of brain tumors.
II.B WHY MACHINE LEARNING AND NEURAL NETWORKS?
In recent years, attention has been paid to artificial intelligence algorithms that help us reduce time and effort and make it easier for us to do our work. One of these works is that it makes it easier for us to identify and classify tumors without the need for radiologists. One of the most popular techniques used in artificial intelligence to identify and classify tumors is machine learning to analyze MRI scans for detection. Which requires a large data set based on MRI images. What distinguishes machine learning is that machine learning models can learn patterns and relationships in the data and can be trained to accurately identify tumors based on features extracted from MRI images. Several experiments have demonstrated the effectiveness of machine learning models in detecting and classifying brain tumors.
combined to segment brain tumors [6]. This method is much faster than those based on image patches. Another study to develop a machine-learning model using a hybrid feature extraction approach using CNN is developed for the localization of tumor region followed by region proposal network (RPN) and achieved an accuracy of 98.1% in classifying brain tumors [7]. Another study one uses deep learning-based techniques for the automatic segmentation and classification of brain tumors using MRI scans as a dataset this model achieves high accuracy [8]. there are many others who used segmentation techniques such as deep learning-based approach for the automatic segmentation and classification of meningioma brain tumors [9]. Another fully Automatic Heterogeneous Segmentation using Support Vector Machine (FAHS-SVM) has been proposed for brain tumor segmentation [10]. Multi-task classification using Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) by segmenting the brain tumor is Another way of segmenting the tumor to classify it [11]. There are more techniques that may can we study such as the experiment which proposed a machine learning-based approach for the detection and classification of glioma brain tumors [12]. A new method for classifying brain tumors from MRI scans using deep learning. By using a 3D convolutional neural network to classify brain tumors, which are then passed to a pre-trained CNN model for feature extraction. The method achieved high accuracy in experiments [13]. Another two deep learning techniques for brain tumor detection and classification using the cutting- edge object detection framework YOLO (You Only Look Once) and the deep learning library Fast Ai, respectively. using 1,992 MRI scans as a dataset. The YOLOv5 model achieved an accuracy of 85.95% and the Fast Ai classification model achieved an accuracy of 95.78% [14]. Another Paper uses a combination of deep and shallow features to distinguish between different types of brain

  tumors and to predict the 1p/19q co-deletion status of LGG tumors. The deep and shallow features are using SVM and k- NN classifier [15]. We also can use k-nearest neighbor (KNN), decision tree, random forest, support vector machine, and artificial neural network (ANN) [16]. Ensemble models that combine multiple classification techniques have also been proposed to improve classification accuracy and use traditional classifiers such as support vector machines (SVMs) and random forests (RFs) [17].another Experiment done using dense convolutional neural networks for feature extraction and a recurrent neural network for classification using a dataset of 422 MRI scans, the main achievement here is that The proposed method does not require manual or automatic segmentation of regions of interest [18]. Another Intelligence method that can be useful to watch and notice the difference between normal and abnormal brains by watching the fast and slow growth of Gliomas by classifying the abnormal brain tumors into HGG or LGG this approach needs to use a Support vector machine (SVM) to classify the abnormal brain tumors in the LGG and HGG [19]. Another similar experiment uses the Faster R-CNN deep learning for detecting the tumor and marking the area of its occurrence with a Region Proposal Network (RPN) in this experiment they use VGG-16 architecture as a base layer for region and classifier network [20]. A smart method was used that depends on detecting cells that grow abnormally, where mathematical tools are used to extract information from the MRI images, these tools are called WAVELETS, where they
make Fourier transforms for the images and then use the support Vector machines algorithm to classify and identify brain tumors [21]. Another experiment used the image segmentation method using Adaptive Convex Region Contour (ACRC) with the Support Vector Machine (SVM) [22]. Another one used a Support Vector Machine (SVM) to classify the brain tumors with an achieved accuracy average of 97.1%, 0.98 area under the curve, 91.9% sensitivity, and 98.0% [23]. Another one used Discrete wavelet transforms (DWT) with the Support Vector Machine (SVM) algorithm for classification and segmentation for pre-processing which has high accuracy results [24]. Another one has used an automated method to detect brain tumors using Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) by saving time by fewer iterations for detection which reduces the consumption time with high accuracy. by using Feed-forward back-prop neural network to classify the tumors [25]. someone has used the Wavelet filter and then apply fuzzy logic to the segmented part the ’classify this segment using the K-nearest neighbors algorithm [26]. There’s someone who used Mathematical ,approaches with Image Segmentation and WAVELET filter but this considers an old methodology we prefer now to use Machine Learning Techniques [27]. Algorithm for slice classification and then transformed from a 2D Image to a 3D Image then used the Rapid Mode Image Matching (RMIM) algorithm to build a 3D model This method has achieved great results, but from my point of view, it is a difficult and expensive method [22]

##   V. INTENDED EXPERIMENTS:
In my opinion, the use of artificial intelligence tools, especially advanced tools such as deep learning and machine learning, helps save time and effort and reduces the burden on humans, especially since these tools have proven their impressive success and effectiveness in classifying and identifying brain tumors. Further research is needed to develop more accurate and robust models that can be integrated into clinical practice I want to classify brain tumors by segmenting MRI brain scans and classify them using conventional neural networks. I want to Run this experiment using Many MRI scans divide into three classifications the first one for training, which must be run after pre-processing phase, the second type for testing which is many MRI scans that will be used for testing our Model designed using Neural Networks using TensorFlow Python Library with Kera’s. The third type is used for Validation, so in this method I can Test my Model.
##  VII. METHODOLOGY
A- The methodology for this research is as follows:
1. Data collection: A huge data set of MRI scans for brains will be collected from hospitals, medical imaging centers, universities, scientific institutes, and doctors' offices, we will use data from Kaggle Here as a dataset.
2. Data preprocessing: The MRI scans will be preprocessed to remove noise and artifacts, and all the scans will be converted to a standard format and standard resolution.
3. Feature extraction: We will extract some features for the brain tumors to set them as input for the Machine-Learning model such as location, volume, size, shape, texture, and intensity.
4. Develop Model: We will develop a Machine- Learning model such as Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) using the pre-processing MRI Scans and their corresponding features.

B- Model Architecture:
I used a huge data set of MRI scans for brains that may be collected from hospitals, medical imaging centers, universities, scientific institutes, and doctors' offices, we will use data from Kaggle Here as a dataset this data set is divided into two classes the first one called “Yes” which indicates that the person has been injured with a brain tumor the other one “NO” which is mean that the person doesn’t injure by brain tumor then we will divide this dataset to three types the first one to train the data which contains, the other one for test the model and the last one to validate the model before making any operations on the data we must prepare the images to be ready to start training or testing so we will make some preprocessing operations. After splitting the data into training and testing sets and normalizing the pixel values of the images using “model_selection” from the Scikit-Learn library we need to Reshape the data to include a single channel for grayscale images using the NumPy library.
To Preprocess the MRI images, we need to resize the images to match the input size of the model then we need to normalize pixel values to the range [0, 1] by dividing/255, also need to add an extra dimension for batch size. In the first step, we must resize the data to (256,256) and convert it to greyscale using an open computer vision library (CV2) we also need to remove noise and artifacts, and all the scans will be converted to a standard format and standard resolution. After that, we will extract some features for the brain tumors to set them as input for the Machine-Learning model such as location, volume, size, shape, texture, and intensity. Then we will develop a Machine-Learning model such as Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) that will be trained using the pre-processing MRI Scans and their corresponding features.
To train the model we need to classify the training data into two main classes ’NO’ for no tumors and ’Yes’ for tumors, so we have just two classes at the first initial stage of this project but in the future, I expect to classify ‘Yes’ class to three classes ‘Glioma tumor’, ‘’Meningioma tumor, and ‘’ Pituitary tumor “. The input shape of our images will be (128,128,3), The number of samples propagated through the network at each training step is 32 and The number of times the entire training dataset is passed through the network during training which is called epochs will be 50 then we will generate data from those images by applying some data augmentation operations like rescaling the images by 1.0/255, shearing the images by 0.2, zooming the images by 0.2, and apply horizontal flipping on the training images and rescaling the valid images by 1.0/255.
The model created using deep learning techniques using Conventional Neural Networks (CNN) with three convolutional layers with max pooling layers which
is attached after the first, five convolutional layers we use it to shrink the representation's spatial dimension to minimize the number of parameters and computations in the network. To predict the output for my model I used method to obtain the predicted probabilities for each class if the class with highest probability the class will be considered as the predilected class. I trained this model using dataset of brain tumor images (MRI scans) detected from Kaggle, we will train these MRI scans using TensorFlow's Kera’s API that can be used to load and preprocess the images. The accuracy and efficiency of the model will be determined by comparing it with a set of metrics, including sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy. The model will compare existing models for brain tumor detection and classification, in each epoch, the model receives a batch of images, performs forward propagation to compute predictions, compares the predictions to the true labels using a loss function.
 I used 5 convolutional layers each layer connected with 1 Max Pooling layer with applying RELU activation function for the convolutional to reduce the spatial dimensions of the feature maps while preserving. the most important information and dense with fully connected (dense) layers but on the last layer we applied SoftMax activation function then there’s the Flatten Layer used to convert the 2D feature maps into a 1D vector, and the last layer in the model is two

dense (fully connected) layers. We compile the model to set the Configuration for training data we used ‘Adam’ as optimizer function to update the model's parameters with adaptive learning rates, helping accelerate convergence as categorical cross-entropy which is suitable for multi-class classification then we fit the model using the batch size and epochs by calculating the number of steps per epoch (calculated based on the batch size and the number of training samples), the number of epochs, the validation data generator, and the number of validation steps. All the Convolutional layers extract features from the input images by applying filters to capture local patterns, The combination of convolutional and pooling layers allows the model to learn hierarchical representations of the input images. The model learns to differentiate between these two classes by adjusting its internal parameters.
The model was created using deep learning techniques using Conventional Neural Networks (CNN) with five convolutional layers with max-pooling layers which are attached after the first, second, third, fourth and the fifth convolutional layers we use it to shrink the representation's spatial dimension to minimize the number of parameters and computations in the network after that there are two fully connected layers. The last one uses the sigmoid activation function to do binary classification with output contain (tumor or no tumors). To predict the output for my model I used the method to obtain the predicted probabilities for each class if the class with highest probability the class will be considered as the predicted class. I trained this model using a dataset of brain tumor images (MRI scans) detected from Kaggle, we will train these MRI scans using TensorFlow's Kera’s API which can be used to load and preprocess the images. The accuracy and efficiency of the model will be determined by comparing it with a set of metrics, including sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy. The model will also be compared against existing models for brain tumor detection and classification.
##  VIII. SOME COMMON MISTAKES
If there are some errors that’s may for many reasons such
as:
• Data imbalance: The dataset may have a
significant class imbalance, where most of the
images belong to the "no tumors" class.
• Training issues: because may the model was not
trained properly or did not converge to an optimal
solution.
• Bug in the code: The code may contain some
logical errors or bugs.

 ##  IX. RESULTS
We expect this model to identify and classify brain tumors with high accuracy, and we also expect it to detect if the image contains brain tumor or not This research will provide a useful tool for clinicians and radiologists in the diagnosis and treatment of brain tumors. For the current stage, I obtained Excellent results I trained my model on 859 MRI scans then I test my model on 98 ‘No Tumors’ MRI scans and 255 ‘Tumors’ MRI scans this gives me that the model predicts 320 images with correct values and 29 one with False detection, so the accuracy percentage for the testing data now is 91.7% which is very good results, I used 50 epochs with 64 batch size, on the first stage I used 10 epochs with small data set the accuracy was 34% but after
training my model on large data with some augmentations the accuracy increased to 72% and by applying after 15 epochs the accuracy raised to 76% but after applying 12 epochs the accuracy raised to 82.45% after that I tried to train my model on 20 epoch with 64 batch size the accuracy increased to 85% after that I added two other convolutional layers with 30 epochs the accuracy increased to 89% after that I added two other layers with batch size 64 and 35 epochs the accuracy increased to 90.8 which is excellent but I tried to add some Augmentation techniques to increase the training data and trying to use 50 epochs the overfitting fixed and the model become better. I think using 50 epochs is suitable for my model.
The confusion matrix for: 10 epochs.
The model fitting for:
10 epochs.
VII. CONCLUSION
In this research, I reached excellent accuracy of 91.7% by using deep learning to classify whether the images have brain tumors or not. Convolutional neural networks were used, which effectively contributed to identifying the affected images. In the future, it is possible to determine the type of tumor if the image is infected, and the system can be made more intelligent to determine the risk ratio and if there is an effective treatment or not, but about the current results, I
